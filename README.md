# Project Title

Creating a Token

## Description

This project is use to demonstrate the use of Solidity which is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing Ethereum-based smart contracts. MyToken is a Ethereum based token contract written in solidity which provides basic functionality for creating and burning tokens. It consists of two functions :  mint function to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address and burn function to destroy existing tokens from a specific address. Both of these functions takes two parameters: address and value.

## Features

Token Minting: Mint new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.
Token Burning: Destroy existing tokens from existing addresses.
Total Supply Management: Keep track of total supply of tokens.
Balance Tracking: Keep track of token balances for each address.
Mapping Variable: Uses a mapping to store token for each address.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To run this program you can use Remix IDE.
To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. 
Click on Create new file and save a file as .sol extension (eg. My_Token.sol). 
Copy and paste the code provided in the github repository.

### Compiling and Deploying 

To compile the contract, click on "Solidity compiler" on the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile My_token.sol" button or we can simply click Ctrl+S to compile the contract.

Once it is compiled you can deploy the contract, by clicking on the "Deploy and Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "My_Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Within the Deployed/Unpinned Contracts, click on the deployed contract (i.e My_Token). Click on the "Mint/Burn" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and mint/burn the tokens.
